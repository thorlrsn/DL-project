# Deep Learning Estimation of 2D Position of Football Field Elements and Players – VEO

- The goal is to create a system capable of detecting players, the field and then be able to apply a prospective transformation to show the position of players on a 2d field. Deep learning models were applied in all the sections marked in red in the project outline below.

## General Information

- The final results are contained in a jupyter notebook in the Final version folder (final_script.ipynb) 
- All the other folders contains the different independent parts developed during this project, the ones used for the final version as well as the ones who had potential to be used.
- General structure:
    - Goal detection
    - Player detection
    - Perspective transform
    - Bird-eye-view
