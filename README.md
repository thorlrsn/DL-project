# Deep Learning Estimation of 2D Position of Football Field Elements and Players â€“ VEO

The goal is to create a system capable of detecting players and the field and then be able to apply a prospective transformation to show the position of players on a 2d field. The project can be divided into three general sections. Deep learning models were applied in every section to different extents.
